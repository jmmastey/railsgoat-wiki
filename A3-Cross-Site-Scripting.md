# Description

XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation and escaping. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

# Bug

Stored Cross-Site Scripting - The following code was taken from app/views/layouts/shared/_header.html.erb

```erb
<li style="color: #FFFFFF">
  <!--
  I'm going to use HTML safe because we had some weird stuff
  going on with funny chars and jquery, plus it says safe so I'm guessing
  nothing bad will happen
  -->
  Welcome, <%= current_user.first_name.html_safe %>
</li>
```
